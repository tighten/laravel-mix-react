# laravel-mix-react

## DEPRECATED -- please use the `mix.react()` method included by default in [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/mix#react)

Easy alternative Laravel Mix configuration for projects using React. Includes the babel loaders and Webpack configuration file
you need to get started. (Please note that this is NOT a drop-in replacement for Laravel Mix -- you will still need to
include the `laravel-mix` package along with this one!)

## Installation
Run `npm install --save-dev laravel-mix-react` or `yarn add --dev laravel-mix-react`

In your project's `package.json`, update all references to `--config="node_modules/laravel-mix/setup/webpack.config.js"` 
within the "scripts" to point to `node_modules/laravel-mix-react/setup/webpack.config.js`.

## Advanced configuration

If you need to make further changes to Webpack, run `cp node_modules/laravel-mix-react/setup/webpack.config.js ./` in your 
terminal. This will copy the modified `webpack.config.js` into the root of your project. Modify your config as needed, and then
remove the `--config="node_modules/laravel-mix-react/setup/webpack.config.js"` lines from your `package.json` file.
